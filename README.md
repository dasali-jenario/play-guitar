- **Sound Map**: Each dice number is mapped to a specific sound, adding variety to practice sessions.

## How to Use

1. Choose the number of dice (1, 2, or 4).
2. Click on 'Roll Dice' to see the random sounds you need to play.
3. Use the metronome to keep time by setting your desired BPM and starting it.
4. Practice playing your guitar along with the rhythm of the dice rolls and metronome.
